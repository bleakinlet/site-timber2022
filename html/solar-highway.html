                    <p class="subtitle">the motw-like ttrpg about friendship in your space-traveling RV</p>
                    <p class="body">
                        <br>A 100-page manual on a lighthearted MotW-like TTRPG I developed with my friends over
                        at the Cryptid Friendclub. The game takes place on the Solar Highway, a road that travels
                        through the universe and stops at the weirdest places.

                        <br> <br>Solar Highway is a full GM system that works well with a casual group. It has 12 unique
                        passenger types you can pick from with custom abilities, moves, futures, and stories.

                        <br><br>This game was designed from the ground up to be played weekly for my group, with people
                        coming
                        in and leaving. Players who can't make it can easily just leave their passenger in the RV.
                        Players can have multiple passengers that they can pick and choose to adventure in new
                        locations. It is designed for simple one-shot sessions, although I've done full campaigns and
                        long, long character arcs.

                        <br><br> Go explore that messed up universe, the RV isn't waiting!
